Fake Fixes:


All of it obscures a simpler solution.

If you're only going to the corner store, ride a bicycle.

If you're only displaying five sentences of text, use vanilla HTML. Hell, serve a textfile! Then you won't need compression hacks, integral signs, or elaborate Gantt charts of what assets load in what order.

Browsers are really, really good at rendering vanilla HTML.

We have the technology.

Nutritionists used to be big on this concept of a food pyramid. I think we need one for the web, to remind ourselves of what a healthy site should look like.

Here is what I recommend for a balanced website in 2015:

A solid base of text worth reading, formatted with a healthy dose of markup.

Some images, in moderation, to illustrate and punch up the visual design.

A dollop of CSS.

And then, very sparingly and only if you need it, JavaScript.

	Instead, here is the web pyramid as we observe it in the wild:
A base layer of HTML

A huge pile of crap

On top of it all, a whole mess of surveillance scripts.
